# Implementation for the paper The Monadic Profunctor Paradigm of Bidirectional Programming

This is the 2025 journal extension of our previous paper [*Composing bidirectional programs monadically*](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-17184-1_6).

The Rocq formalization of our results is under `rocq/`.
The updated code can be found under `code/`.

## Rocq formalization

Rocq proofs of compositionality for some properties of biparsers and lenses.

This is built with Rocq version 8.20 (pre-renaming, `coq.8.20` on opam).
